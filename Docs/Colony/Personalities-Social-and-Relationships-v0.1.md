# Personalities, Social & Relationships (v0.1, Docs Only)

> **Update:** Loyalty & Mentor/Bond tokens.

- **Loyalty** sources: relationship to leader, job satisfaction, favors/debts, fear/respect, promises kept.
- **Bond Tokens:** earned via Mentor sessions and social milestones; can **override** one apprentice betrayal/refusal per saga step.
- **Grievances:** forcing a pawn down an opposed Ethos path adds *You Crossed a Line* grievance (weight scales with Ethos delta).
