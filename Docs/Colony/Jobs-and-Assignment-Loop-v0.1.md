# Jobs & Assignment Loop (v0.1, Docs Only)
> **Amended (v0.2):** Jobs are **civilian/economic**; **combat abilities** now unlock via **Classes**.

- **Renames:** `Warden` day-job → **Wardkeeper** (facility power/wards). `Healer` (day-job combat unlocks) → **Infirmarian** (infirmary/triage; non-combat).  
- **Hunter** is a day-job for field dressing/hunting (non-combat), synergizes with **Ranger** class if present.
- **Mentorship:** unchanged; affects JobXP only.
- **RTwP:** Job tracks no longer add combat abilities to the hotbar; those now come from **Class** level. Field actions remain (e.g., “Recharge Wards”, “Batch Craft”).
