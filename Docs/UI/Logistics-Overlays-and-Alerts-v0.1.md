# Logistics Overlays & Alerts (v0.1, Docs Only)

## Overlays
- **Logistics**: heatmap of recent path traffic, arrows on active haul routes, floor speed tints, path penalties icons (doors/stairs).
- **Stockpiles**: filter chips and priority digits painted over zones/containers; link lines from stations to inputs/outputs.
- **Spoilage**: items tinted by phase with ETA labels; cold containers/rooms show snowflake badges.

## Panels
- **Reservations**: list of reserved stacks (“by who → for what”), with jump-to buttons.
- **Counters**: virtual counters for meals, planks, ingots; “Maintain Y” quick-setup.
- **Carts & Stables**: assign carts/animals to routes; show durability/upkeep.

## Alerts (one-click fixes)
- **No Cold Storage** → suggest building **Cold Chest** or **Cold Room**, or toggling a kitchen recipe to “dry goods only”.
- **Haul Backlog** → suggest enabling **Logistics** as Secondary for more pawns, or building a **Cart**.
- **Input Link Broken** → open Station panel’s **Links** and highlight missing target.
- **Food < 1 day** → propose emergency **Gruel** bill, raise **Cook** job request at dawn.
