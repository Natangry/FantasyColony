# ADR-0001: Combat Model â€” Real-Time with Pause + Assume Control
**Decision:** RTwP with one controllable pawn (WASD), others on Gambits; two-tier gizmos; scene-swap arenas.
**Alternatives considered:** ATB lanes, mini-tactics grid, auto-battler; chosen for readability, modding ergonomics, and integration with colony autonomy.
**Consequences:** Lower animation/pathing cost vs grids; requires clear telegraphs and autopause UX.
