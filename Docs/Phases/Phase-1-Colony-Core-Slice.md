# Phase 1: Vertical Slice A — Colony Core
Time/map/biome; autonomy; needs/mood; chores; policies; resources; buildings; UX & QoL; save/load.

**Construction & Bills:** Blueprint by layers (Structure/Surface/Room/Furniture/Service Points). After construction, select a building to **assign a designation** (Bar/Workshop/Inn/Shop/Chapel). The **Building Inspector** shows required items/staff to function and an operational state (Closed/Limited/Open/Excellent).

**New Game Onboarding:** The **Frontier Refugees** scenario aligns with Week-1 objectives: campfire/bedrolls/stockpile, cook 6 meals (Gruel fallback if low), build Workbench & Tool Rack by Day 3, place Warding Totem, craft Repair Kits, and assign first **station shifts**.

**Acceptance:** harvest→craft→build loop; moods visible; save/load stable.
