# Faction Mutators & Settlement Scenes (v0.1, Docs Only)
> **Update:** Settlement hooks apply **lot/service/population/law** deltas.

- **Corrupt Regime:** adds Black Market, bribe desks; lowers patrols; price & law toggles.
- **Plagued:** adds Clinic & Quarantine; screenings at gates; curfew; festival cancellations.
- **Soul Looms:** unique vendor & blueprints; rumor weights; chapel lines mention soul weaving.
- **Bridge Down (route tag):** ferry notices, caravan rarity; repair quest stubs.

Hooks are implemented via `SettlementMutatorHookDef` and `SettlementConditionHookDef` (see schema addendum).
