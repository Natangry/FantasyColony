# Factions, Reputation & Diplomacy (v0.1, Docs Only)

> **Update:** Reputation Credits & sponsor logic.

- **ReputationCreditDef:** converts faction standing into temporary **discounts**, **stock boosts**, and **haggling floors** after catastrophe.
- **Sponsor Caravan:** friendly factions dispatch aid proportional to rep & catastrophe tier; hostility suspends sponsorship.
- **Law/Tax:** temporary tariff waivers possible for allies; corrupt regimes may demand "processing fees".
